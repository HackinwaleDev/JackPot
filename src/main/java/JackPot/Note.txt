SOMETHING WORTH NOTED
I have a class variable (List actually) which initially was empty until I filled
it up with data (48 elements). I then passed this variable to a method as param-
eter but something strange happened: As I was reducing the element of param it 
was taking effect on the class variable which I passed as well.
Something I never knew it possible.

Truth is learning has no end. And experience is the best teacher. I wouldn't have
known this if I had not try different approach in solving a particular problem.
